# README ‚ô•Ô∏è
These are some premium accounts that I have cracked using logs. I am not the administrator of these accounts.

These are cookies that are used by a particular website when a user logs in to their website. In this case, it's the cookies from the Netflix website. When you use these cookies, you are logging into someone else's account that I do not have access to.

If the user finds out that you are using their account, they can sue you and I am not responsible for that. So please do not add profiles, change passwords, or kick account owners. This will cause the cookies to be changed and then you will no longer have access to the Netflix account. If you behave properly, you have a chance to keep a Netflix account for decades or even a lifetime. The decision is up to you.

Remember, this is a gray area that borders on illegality and unethical behavior. Using someone else's account without permission violates Netflix's terms of service and can have serious consequences. It's important to be aware of the risks involved.

Additionally, relying on these cookies is not a stable solution. Account owners can change their passwords or update their security settings at any time, which will invalidate the cookies and cut off your access. Always have a backup plan or consider subscribing to Netflix yourself for uninterrupted service.

Think carefully about your actions and make informed decisions. Respecting others' digital property is crucial in maintaining a fair and just online environment.
